CrowdFMS is a framework for automating collection and processing of samples from
VirusTotal, by leveraging the Private API system.   This framework automatically 
downloads recent samples, which triggered an alert on the users YARA notification feed. 

Users can also specify a command to execute on these newly downloaded samples, 
based on their YARA rule name.  For example, a user can specify that all samples 
that matched the YARA rule “Zeus”, be automatically submitted to Cuckoo sandbox.
